What could be improved (cons):
1. Channel and WaitGroup misuse
You add to wg only once at len(l.readyCh) before goroutines actually enqueue new apps → risk of mismatch.

If l.readyCh gets new items dynamically (via l.readyCh <- up), you may end up closing the channel while something is still running, or never calling wg.Done() for all additions.

Safer: count all tasks dynamically (wg.Add() right before each goroutine) and close readyCh only after the graph is exhausted, not from inside Shutdown.

2. Error propagation is incomplete
You only check firstErr after the first loop. If later errors occur after the main loop finishes, you won't catch them unless you wait for wg.Wait() first.

Ideally, wait for all tasks to finish, then return the first error.

3. Context not honored
Shutdown(c context.Context) takes a context but doesn’t check c.Done() anywhere.

If a closer blocks or takes too long, you can’t cancel it gracefully.

4. No deterministic order for ties
When two apps have indegree zero, shutdown order is random (map iteration order).

Usually fine for parallelism, but for debugging you might want deterministic ordering (e.g. sort keys before enqueue).

5. Graph validation
No cycle detection → if someone mistakenly registers a circular dependency, you’ll deadlock.
